# CatAdoption
Author: OlA Altiti

This simple website provides a list of cats to be available for volunteers which I hope will encourage people to help cats to get a safe and comfortable home.

I got some problems while building this website, however, I searched and learned very interesting things such as Node js, Axios and express. The following links have been used:
